            I am Vanford Clothify
      </p>
      <p>
        A young lady who is learning fashion designing as a career&#46;

      </p>
      <p>
        I Have been learning for three years now and  I am learning new things day in and out&#46;
      </p>
      <p>
        I Have Been Drawing Since Childhood And I Was Very Creative As Well&#46;
      </p>
      <p>
        At My Senior High Level I Realised I have to Send This Creativity To Another Level&#46;
      </p>
      <p>
        I Started Sketching Clothes Perfectly With Different Designs, 
      </p>
      <p>
        So I Motivated By Mother And Friends To Go Into Fashion Designing&#46;
        And I Have Not Regretted&#46;
